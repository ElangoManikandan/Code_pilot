PROMISE
    A promise in Javascript is an Object that represents the result of an Asyncronous Operation.
    It can be in one of the Three Stages
    1.Pending
    2.Fulfilled
    3.Rejected

    Why we need promises?
    -Handles Async Tasks
    -Avoids CallBack hell

    .then()- for success,
    .catch()-for errors,
    .finally() for Cleanup.
