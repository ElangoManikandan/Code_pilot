         ðŸ‘‰ HTML Page

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello World</h1>
    <p>Welcome to JavaScript DOM</p>
  </body>
</html>

ðŸ‘‰ Browser Creates DOM Tree

Document(node)
 â””â”€â”€ html
      â”œâ”€â”€ body
      â”‚    â”œâ”€â”€ h1 â†’ "Hello World"
      â”‚    â””â”€â”€ p/  â†’ "Welcome to JavaScript DOM"
      |â”€â”€ head

The browser converts your HTML document into 
   a tree-like structure of objects that JavaScript 
   can read, modify, or delete.


ðŸ‘‰ Now with JavaScript, you can:

    --> Change <h1> text
    --> Add a new <button>
    --> Delete <p>

ðŸ‘‰ DOM is a bridge between HTML and JavaScript.
   It lets JS talk to HTML elements and control them dynamically
