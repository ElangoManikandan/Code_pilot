    <p style="text-align: center;padding: 0 300px;">Linux is one of the most prominent examples of <span style="color: blue;">free and open-source software </span>collaboration. While originally developed for x86 based personal computers, it has since been ported to more platforms than any other operating system and is used on a wide variety of devices including PCs, workstations, mainframes and embedded systems. Linux is the predominant operating system for servers and is also used on all of the world's 500 fastest supercomputers. When combined with Android, which is Linux-based and designed for smartphones, they have the <span style="color: blue;">largest installed base of all general-purpose operating systems.</span></p>
