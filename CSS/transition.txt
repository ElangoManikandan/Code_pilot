Here are the 4 main components (types) of CSS transitions:

transition-property
    Specifies the CSS property to which the transition is applied 
    (e.g., background-color, width). 
    Use all to apply to all changeable properties.

transition-duration
    Defines how long the transition takes to complete 
    (e.g., 0.5s, 1s). 

transition-timing-function
    Describes how the intermediate values 
    of the transition are calculated 
    (e.g., ease, linear).

transition-delay
    Sets a delay before the transition starts (e.g., 0.2s).      

Use transition to animate CSS property changes smoothly.

Main properties:

    transition-property

    transition-duration

    transition-timing-function

    transition-delay

using shorthand: transition: all 0.5s ease-in-out 0s;
